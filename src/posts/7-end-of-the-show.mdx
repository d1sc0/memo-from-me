This week I announce the end of this little audio experiment! In the memo I cover what I’ve learnt and my reasons for ending it here.

I would like to thank those who have taken the time to listen and give feedback. This has meant a lot to me and has been really useful. I will be continuing to post audio notes, but they’ll move under my personal website/blog. Please consider resubscribing using the links below.

This site will stay live for a wee bit longer but all new content will appear under over at hellostu.xyz
