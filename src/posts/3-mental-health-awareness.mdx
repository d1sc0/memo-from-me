**Content Warning**: This episode contains content and themes about suicide and mental health illness. I know these subjects are sensitive, and not everybody will be comfortable listening. If this is you, please skip ahead to another episode.

This week is the end of mental health awareness month in the UK, and I wanted to use it as an opportunity to share what I’ve experienced and learnt over the last year. I hope the results might not be as hard to listen to as they were to record, but please let me have any feedback. Apologies for my quaking voice tremors, nervous coughs and the squeaky gate. I nearly didn’t publish the post, but I remain hopeful there are things contained within that might be useful for others. If nothing else, I feel like I’m doing my part in normalising conversations about mental health and taking the opportunity to thank those who have supported me and my family.
